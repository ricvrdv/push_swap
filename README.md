# PUSH_SWAP

### [MILESTONE 2]
### SUMMARY
In this repository you can find the code implementation for the PUSH_SWAP project for 42. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. 

The program, `push_swap`, takes a list of integers as input, sorts them using two stacks (a and b), and outputs the smallest sequence of operations to achieve the sorted stack. The project also includes a `checker` program to verify the correctness of the sorting instructions.
